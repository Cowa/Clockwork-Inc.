## Story

You are a worker in a factory with one goal: charge batteries and get paid.

Your job is very tiring but at least you can spend your coin in a toy capsule machine.

And you really want **to collect all of these toys!**

## Game

The ultimate goal is to collect the 8 rewards from the capsule machine. But to complete this, you must work hard to earn coins and be lucky (otherwise you'll work even more!).

## Made with

Godot engine, Inkscape & Bfxr.
